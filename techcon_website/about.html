            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>TechCon began in 2015 as a small meet-up of passionate tech minds in Lagos, Nigeria. What started as a modest gathering of 
                50 attendees has now grown into one of Africa’s most influential technology conferences, drawing thousands of participants 
                from around the world each year. The event was created to give a voice to local developers, startups, and innovators — and
                 over the years, it has expanded to include global tech leaders, investors, educators, and students.

Through the years, TechCon has been a platform for launching groundbreaking ideas, fostering partnerships, and shaping the future of technology in Africa and beyond.
